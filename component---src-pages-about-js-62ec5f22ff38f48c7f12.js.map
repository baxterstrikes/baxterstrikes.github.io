Recently, I found the gumption to finally go for it and pursue UX design full time.</p>\n                        <div className=\"flex justify-left\">\n                            <a href=\"/Lynn Baxter Résumé.pdf\"\n                                className=\"text-btn py-1 px-3 my-8 border border-current text-gondola hover:bg-au_chico hover:text-white hover:border-transparent rounded inline-flex items-center justify-center\">\n                                <span>Download my resume</span>\n                            </a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"sm:clear-left mt-8 mb-4 text-H2 font-bold font-serif\">My design philosophy</div>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">I am interested in people — I find each individual fascinating and complex. In design, my first step is to always find a person who is encountering a difficulty. When we search for a problem to solve, we are really searching for a person or people we want to help. What I’ve found is when you ask a group of people the right questions, you can single out a problem that each and every one of them is trying to solve, or has already solved in a different way. Using that information, a designer has a good base for the creation of a solution to test.</p>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">I believe that design must be inclusive to be called good design. It is part of my job as a designer to look at a problem from all possible perspectives, this includes a lens for people from all demographics and abilities.</p>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">My primary goal in life is to remain flexible. I would never feel comfortable being a person who is stuck within their own perspective. I use many different methods in my life to ensure that I am seeing the issue from as many angles as possible. It is my firm belief that you can’t learn anything if you think you already know everything.</p>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">What drives me are those moments when something I’ve created helps another person be their best selves. If I can help even one person accomplish a goal, I am satisfied. Multiply that to a large scale? Pure joy.</p>\n\n                <div className=\"sm:clear-left mt-8 mb-4 text-H2 font-bold font-serif\">How I work in a team</div>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">I’ll be real with you, I married a software engineer. I am well-versed in collaborating with many different skill types in tech due to my background as a facilities manager in startups. I’ve worked well with designers, engineers, data science, customer support, C-level execs, marketing professionals, and so many more. These skills helped me during my time in Lambda’s UX track - each and every project I worked on was a true collaboration that I enjoyed immensely.</p>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">As a designer, I like to function as the person who is always asking questions to both clarify my understanding and learn as much as possible from others. Growing a career in tech without having a background in product gave me an education in how to function in a world I knew nothing about. I am so grateful for all my experiences because I’ve learned what questions to ask and who I could get answers from. These environments empowered me to never feel intimidated by any person or any task, but instead to feel endlessly curious.</p>\n\n                <div className=\"mt-8 mb-4 text-H2 font-bold font-serif\">Additional tidbits...</div>\n                <ul className=\"list-none\">\n                    <li className=\"my-4\">The books I gravitate towards tend to be science fiction, fantasy, and mystery.
