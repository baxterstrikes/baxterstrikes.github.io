            <p>My first step was to take a deep dive into the research the previous team had compiled. I learned that
                our potential user base had 2 categories: book lovers who are always searching for new books they will

                    <p>All of the potential users I spoke to wished they could read more books, and indicated they would

            </br>
            <p>I noticed in the original design that the primary color made the product feel busy as well as outdated.
                As I researched our competition and similar interfaces, <span class="font-bold">I realized that visually
                    we were dealing with a

                overwhelming

            <p>I tried applying new colors to the original design, but I soon realized <span class="font-bold">I needed
                    to bleed out nearly all of the color from the UI to compensate for the vibrancy and variation in the

            </br>
            <p>Users are asked to give us their preferred genres during onboarding so we can start to build their
                personal recommendation model. Our model knows why we are recommending a book, but the user wants to
                know as well. </p>

            <p>In the book details, <span class="font-bold">I originally thought that users would want to write their
                    own private book notes.</span> I learned from the users I spoke to that they found little value in
                this feature and instead wanted to group books in their own private collections using tags!</p>

            <img src="../images/nextbookstudy/nbpc2.png">
            </br>
            <p>I started seeing the final design in this iteration. I wanted to preserve the top right space for
                personalization and dedicate enough real estate to related book recommendations.</p>
            </br>
            <img src="../images/nextbookstudy/nbpc3.png">
            </br>
            <p>Once I nailed down the personalization and recommendations sections, I realized I had plenty of room to
                blow up the book cover, which created an incredibly unique visuality to each book details page.</p>

            <p>Key insights from book details usability tests</p>
            </br>
            <p class="font-bold">Users want relevant information and literally nothing else.</p>
            </br>
            <p>What I found interesing was the amount of ways people conceived of a book details page. Some wanted more
                information, but many wanted a more minimalistic design that focused on the single action they wanted to
                take: adding books to their collections.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="font-bold">Related books and recommended books mean the same thing to users.</p>
            </br>
            <p>I was surprised to learn that people were conflating these two terms. To me, a related book is a book by
                the same author, in the same series, or takes place in the same fictional universe. A recommendations
                model may include these factors, and so many more!</p>
            </br>
            <p>How do people want their book collections displayed?</p>
            <p>As soon as I started adding in book covers and moving to high fidelity, I realized I had a navigation
                issue. I broke out what started as the user profile page into 2 parts: a private book collections page
                and a user profile modal (seen in the final designs below).</p>

            <p class="font-bold">Users thought the stacking of the books created an attention-grabbing feature.</p>
            <p>Although many of my peers and advisors thought that the flat card design and the 3d stack design were
                both acceptable, the 3d effect was the most interesting and added an element of fun to the page.</p>

            <img src="../images/nextbookstudy/nbfd1.png">
            </br>
            <p>The goal of the home page was to showcase book recommendations. You can see here that our recommendations
                take up the entire lower half of the page. We also made it eady for the user to choose their next book
                from their “Up next” collection.</p>

            </br>
            <p>I was so pleased to find that multiple users thought this 3D-style stacking visual was intriguing and it
                didn’t distract from the purpose of the page.</p>

            </br>
            <p>This is the book details page, where users can add the book to any collection. Users felt it was
                important to be able to use a tag-like system since it is something they recognize easily.</p>
            </br>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-bamboo">What I learned...</h3>
            </br>
            <p>I was grateful for the opportunity to design solely for desktop, something I hadn’t really done in my
                previous projects.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="font-bold">How to break my tendency to design myself into a box I can’t get out of.</p>
            <p>I was excited to once again design something by myself, it was my impression that the more people you add
                into the mix, the longer things can take. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I found myself going too deep
                into details too early, I felt unsure how to move forward several times, and my ability to be creative
                took a nosedive. I realized how important it is to be constantly collaborating with not only your
                developers, but with other designers.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="font-bold">Don’t get spooked by a due date</p>
            <p>I was still wireframing in week 3 and the project was due in completion at the end of week 4. Although I
                did have a solid reason behind the decision to remain in low fidelity that long - I was looking at other
                projects done in the same time frame and started doubting my decisions, process, and progress. I had to
                remind myself that pacing is important and everything is a learning experience. I will say that I had to
                pull it together quickly near the end, but everything turned out great!</p>
