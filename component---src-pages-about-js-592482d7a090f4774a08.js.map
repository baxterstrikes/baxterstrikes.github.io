So I fed my curiosity by reading about the world beyond my tiny town. And the first chance I had, I made the move to San Francisco to pursue a degree in biology at San Francisco State.</p>\n\n                <div className=\"my-4 text-B1 font-bold\">A tale of science and startups</div>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">Studying biology meant I could finally get answers to some of the questions that kept me up at night. I threw myself into biology coursework and derived an obscene amount of joy from planning research projects and experiments.</p>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">After college, my first job was at a small startup in San Francisco. At the time, it occurred to me that the world of startups wasn’t unlike the world of science: Everyone was building products that were, essentially, ongoing experiments. Product people, as I learned, were the scientists that conducted the experiments so that they could ultimately build a more valuable product offering. For more than seven years, the moving pieces of startups fascinated me, and fueled my career as a facilities professional at companies like Slack and Blend.</p>\n\n                <div className=\"my-4 text-B1 font-bold\">Discovering my love of product</div>\n                <p className=\"my-4\">I’ve always asked a lot of questions of the world. But after nearly a decade in facilities, I started asking questions of myself. And what I discovered was that it was time for a challenge. Instead of merely observing the product experiments I’d seen at startups over the years, I wanted to be a part of them — specifically, as a UX designer. So, much like I did when I left home to explore the broader world beyond my hometown many years ago, I’m beginning my journey into the world of product and UX design. I’m excited about what the future holds!</p>\n\n                <div className=\"my-4 text-H2 font-bold text-pumpkin\">Additional tidbits...</div>\n                <ul className=\"list-disc ml-6\">\n                    <li className=\"my-4\">The books I gravitate towards tend to be science fiction, fantasy, and mystery.
